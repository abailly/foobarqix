## FooBarQix

An answer to the [FooBarQix](http://www.code-story.net/2011/11/16/foobarqix.html) problem. I was too lazy to convert my initial Haskell program to Scala, Clojure or any of the zillions language running on a JVM, so I wrote a wrapper to at least respect the exact word of the rules, if not its spirit.

## Instructions to use

* Install [Haskell platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) and make sure program `runhaskell` is in your `PATH` (or equivalent for your system)
* Install Java JDK
* Compile the Wrapper.java program: `javac Wrapper.java`
* Run the program: `java Wrapper`

A large number of things can go awfully wrong in this process but hopefully stack traces shall be explicit.
